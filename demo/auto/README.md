# Automated Test

Automation test extension, implemented via WebSocket to run automation test cases/groups in iofod generated projects, also supports access to third party projects using iofod test specifications.

## Usage

- After opening this extension, select the test case/group in the current project, configure the target source where the case/group needs to be run and
- Ensure that the target source is started properly

For projects generated by the iofod parser, execute the following command in the project directory.

```bash
iofod auto
```

The iofod cli tool will automatically read the project's environment configuration file and start the WebSocket server.

- Configure the iofod project with automatic testing enabled (by default in dev mode, local debug mode is enabled)
- Once you have done the above, click [Run] to start the automation tests on the target source

## Third party projects

This extension only cares about the use cases/groups of data that the target source can receive from the synchronization, not the specific implementation of the target source, so developers can parse the use cases of the iofod project to implement their own automation test logic.
